    }, []); // The useEffect function has two parameters, the first is the function that will be executed, the second is what are the dependecies (or in other words, what are the things that it must pay attention to in orther to detect a change and then run a function). If the second parameter is an empty array, then it will execute the function only once, when the element that has this function appear on screen. Is the useEffect is used without the second parameter it will generate an infinite loop. Another problem might be if a change the variable I am wathcing throught the use of the useEffect function, it will also generate an infinite loop.
